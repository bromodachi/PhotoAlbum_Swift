# PhotoAlbum_Swift
Please note, there are some files that aren't supposed to be repo. I need to remove some of them. The only ones that are actually
used are listOfAlbums.swift, CustomCell.swift, hiroshi.png, and Album.swift.
This is really barebones at the moment. All you can do is add, delete, and rename albums(you can rename mutiple of them at a time).

One or more of the features next to be implemented in next push:
Hide buttons for certain actions - very simple to do
List photos in an album - will have to find a way to store photos on the phone. Use NSURL? A user-friendly approach would be
just to allow them to paste the image. Will have to see how to do the later approach.
Delete multiple albums
Ask for the album's password, if there is one, before showing the list of photos in that album.
